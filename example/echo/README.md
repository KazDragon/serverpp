A program that showcases the basic functionality of Server++ by implementing a server that echoes all input back to its client.

```bash
./echo server
```

You should see a message saying that the server is started up on a particular port.  You can view the results by connecting to that port number with your favourite Telnet client, and by typing any text you like.
